# Cordic-Implementation-on-FPGA

The Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) method may be used to do trigonometric computations in a wide range of applications. Because CORDIC just requires addition, subtraction, bit shifting, and a lookup table, it is frequently used without a hardware multiplier. 

A CORDIC-based processor for sine/cosine calculation was designed using Verilog programming in Xilinx vivado. The CORDIC module was tested for its functionality and correctness by test-bench analysis. Subsequently, FPGA implementation of the CORDIC core followed by ChipScopePro analysis of the output logic waveforms was performed.
